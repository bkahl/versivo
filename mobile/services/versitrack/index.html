					<h2>VersiTrack <span style="color: #D41314;">- Asset Tracking System</span></h2>
					
					<p><img src="../../images/Versitrack_logo.jpg" align="left" />VersiTrack is a configurable case management and asset tracking system that provides for chain-of-custody tracking, case information collection, and work order queuing through a rich user interface that leverages barcode scanning for quick updates to cases and assets. VersiTrack provides a robust dashboard that allow management to have a bird's eye view of both case management and asset tracking operations to ensure that customers are being served efficiently while preserving necessary data about these transactions. Built on a proven Microsoft platform, VersiTrack is capable of handling large quantities of cases and assets in a multi-user environment while integrating with Microsoft Report Services to ensure that all data stored within the system can be accessible through easily configured reports.  The following information describes the different aspects of the VersiTrack application in greater detail:</p>
					
					<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Case Management -</span> Provides the capability to track cases as queued items that are worked sequentially or in an ad-hoc fashion.  By queuing cases, an organization can manage workload through a fully automated case assignment tool while managers monitor assignments through dashboard views.  VersiTrack provides limitless potential for categorizing case and maintaining case notes.  Case management allows an organization to collect valuable metrics about the time it takes to complete a case, the type of cases being worked, and overall volume of cases being initiated.  Drawing associations to a customer (or involved party) and related assets makes each case multidimensional, providing reporting from many different perspectives.  Through an additional read-only application, an organization can also share the status of active cases with parties beyond the staff working cases.</p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Workflow -</span> Provides the ability to associate assets being tracked in VersiTrack with detailed tasks of a business process lifecycle. The Workflow module includes a drag-and-drop interface to define workflow templates and create ad hoc tasks to enable managers to gain better control and insight into their business operations.  Increased accountability, better analytics and improved customer service are just a few of the many benefits of the VersiTrack Workflow module. </p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Reporting Services -</span> Integrates with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services to provide users with the ability to closely monitor critical performance aspects of a VersiTrack implementation. Using the built-in web-based Report Builder, software developers and end-users can create, publish and share reports on virtually any data element available in the VersiTrack database via a zero programming required interface. The VersiTrack Reporting Services module comes with over 10 standard reports that can be used out-of-the-box or further customized to meet specific business needs.</p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Document Imaging -</span> Scans paper documents using TWAIN compatible devices. Standard features include black & white, full color and optimized grayscale scanning with output to multipage TIFF, PDF or JPEG. The included VersiTrack document imaging viewer allows users to print, email, annotate and redact VersiTrack controlled images. Optional features include OCR, barcode recognition and ISIS scanning.</p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Release Scripts -</span> Prebuilt scripts to automatically release VersiTrack content to third-party systems. For example, customers may elect to use the VersiTrack Document Imaging module to convert paper documents into electronic documents and store them in VersiTrack until a point in the business process is reached that makes them eligible for archiving in the customer's electronic content management systems (e.g., OnBase, Documentum, IBM FileNet Content Manager, SharePoint, etc.).</p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">External Connector -</span> Provides access to electronic content stored in third-party repositories. To provide users with easy access to all the information they might need to make informed business decisions, the External Connector module can be configured to link VersiTrack records to records in compatible external systems. Source system API or database access is typically required for customers who use the External Connector module.</p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Active Directory Single Sign On -</span> Allows organizations to manage VersiTrack security credentials in Microsoft Active Directory. With Active Directory SSO enabled, users only need to log into their network connected workstation and launch VersiTrack. VersiTrack will verify their credentials in Active Directory and give them the appropriate access to the VersiTrack application.</p>
						<p><span style="color: #004B8D; font-weight: bold;">Offline Data Access & Synchronization -</span> Provides limited offline access to VersiTrack data when a secure network connection is not available and customers need access to existing data or the ability to track new records. Currently, the Offline Data Access & Synchronization module provides read-only access to existing records and the ability to begin tracking new records. New records added to the repository in offline mode can automatically be synchronized with the centralized VersiTrack database when a network connection is available.</p>
